<h4>
    Sir Donald George Bradman AC, also known as "The Don," was an Australian cricketer born in Cootamundra, New South Wales, Australia, on August 27, 1908. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, with a Test match career record of 6,996 runs at an average of 99.94 runs. Bradman's exceptional skill and achievements in cricket, including numerous record-breaking innings, have solidified his legacy in the sport. Beyond his sporting career, he was also a stockbroker, cricket administrator, and author, contributing significantly to the game both on and off the field. Bradman died on February 25, 2001, in Kensington Park, South Australia, at the age of 92. He was knighted in 1949 and remains the only Australian cricketer to be knighted for his services to cricket. He was honored by various Australian organizations as the male athlete of the 20th century, the top Australian athlete of the 20th century, and the greatest male athlete of the past 200 years</h4>
